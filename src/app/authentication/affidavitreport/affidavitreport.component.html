        <p>I certify that the data submitted is complete and accurate information and authorize the Department to file unemployment
          claims for each individual included in the electronic file. I certify these employees have authorized this employer to file these
          claims on their behalf and to provide wage information to the Department. I certify that these employees have been allowed
          to choose their preferred federal tax deduction option. I further certify that these employees have been advised that they must
          provide me with their current address and if it changes they must notify me immediately.
          </p>
      
        <p>I understand that the law provides penalties for submitting false claims. I further understand that, under the Rules of the
          Department, any employer found to be abusing the purpose and intent of the Partial Claims Program will be prohibited from
          using the system. You are not allowed to file your own claim. Questions concerning this document should be referred to the
          Payment Processing Unit at (334)956-7481.</p>
